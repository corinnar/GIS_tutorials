MAPPING TO SUPPORT REDD+ PLANNING AND SECURE MULTIPLE BENEFITS: TOOLBOX AND TUTORIALS FOR QGIS AND ARCGIS
=========================================================================================================

GIS training materials and tools have been developed for use in planning REDD+ activities that deliver multiple benefits. These resources are designed to assist technical staff to undertake spatial analysis to identify areas suitable for specific REDD+ policies and measures, and which are likely to yield multiple benefits. Materials have been developed for both QGIS (open-source) and ArcGIS software, according to the needs of individual partner countries. The materials continue to be developed and tested with country partners, with tutorials shared in different languages as available.
